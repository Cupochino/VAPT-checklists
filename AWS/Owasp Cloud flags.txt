 Broken Access Control
IAM Permissions Misconfiguration:

If an IAM role has overly broad permissions, such as "Action": "*" or "Resource": "*", this could be flagged as a vulnerability.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws iam get-role --role-name <role-name>
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Role": {
    "RoleName": "ExampleRole",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ExampleRole",
    "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": { ... },
    "AttachedPolicies": [
      {
        "PolicyName": "AdministratorAccess",
        "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
      }
    ]
  }
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: If the AdministratorAccess policy is attached, it grants full administrative permissions to the role, which may violate the principle of least privilege.

2. Sensitive Data Exposure
Unencrypted S3 Bucket:

If an S3 bucket is found to be unencrypted or has public access, this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
    "Rules": [
      {
        "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
          "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: If no encryption is configured, this is a potential risk, as sensitive data might be stored in plaintext.

Public S3 Bucket:

If a bucket is publicly accessible, flag this as a vulnerability.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Owner": { ... },
  "Grants": [
    {
      "Grantee": {
        "Type": "CanonicalUser",
        "ID": "example-id",
        "DisplayName": "example-user"
      },
      "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
    },
    {
      "Grantee": {
        "Type": "Group",
        "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
      },
      "Permission": "READ"
    }
  ]
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: If you see "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers" and "Permission": "READ", the bucket is publicly readable.

3. Lack of Security Logging and Monitoring
CloudTrail Not Enabled:

If AWS CloudTrail is not enabled or improperly configured, this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws cloudtrail describe-trails
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "trailList": []
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: An empty list means CloudTrail is not enabled, which could lead to lack of auditing and monitoring of API activity.

CloudWatch Logs Not Configured:

If logs for services like EC2, Lambda, and RDS are not being sent to CloudWatch Logs, this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws logs describe-log-groups
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "logGroups": []
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: No log groups means logs are not being collected or monitored, increasing the risk of undetected malicious activity.

4. Insecure APIs
API Gateway Without Authentication:

If an API Gateway endpoint is not protected by any authentication method (e.g., IAM, API key, Lambda authorizer), flag this as a vulnerability.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws apigateway get-method --rest-api-id <api-id> --resource-id <resource-id> --http-method GET
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "authorizationType": "NONE"
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: "authorizationType": "NONE" means the API method is not secured, which is a significant security risk.

5. Misconfigured Cloud Services
Security Group with Open Inbound Ports:

If an EC2 instance's security group allows unrestricted inbound traffic (e.g., from 0.0.0.0/0), this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <sg-id>
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "SecurityGroups": [
    {
      "GroupId": "sg-0123456789abcdef0",
      "GroupName": "example-security-group",
      "IpPermissions": [
        {
          "IpProtocol": "tcp",
          "FromPort": 22,
          "ToPort": 22,
          "IpRanges": [
            {
              "CidrIp": "0.0.0.0/0"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: "CidrIp": "0.0.0.0/0" means the security group allows SSH access from any IP address, which is a major security risk.

6. Serverless Security Risks
Lambda Function with Excessive Permissions:

If a Lambda function has overly broad permissions, such as "Action": "*" or "Resource": "*", this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws lambda get-policy --function-name <function-name>
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":\"*\",\"Resource\":\"*\"}]}"
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: "Action": "*" and "Resource": "*" means the Lambda function has full access to all AWS resources, violating the least privilege principle.

7. Container and Orchestration Security
Unscanned Docker Images in ECR:

If images in Amazon ECR are not scanned for vulnerabilities, this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws ecr describe-repositories
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "repositoryName": "example-repo",
      "repositoryUri": "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example-repo",
      "imageScanningConfiguration": {
        "scanOnPush": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: "scanOnPush": false means that newly pushed images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities.

8. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Injection Attacks
WAF Not Configured:

If the AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is not set up to filter XSS or injection attacks, this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws wafv2 list-web-acls
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "WebACLs": []
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: An empty list indicates that AWS WAF is not configured, increasing the risk of attacks like XSS and SQL injection.

9. Insufficient Identity and Credential Management
Unrotated Access Keys:

If IAM user access keys have been active for too long and have not been rotated, flag this as a vulnerability.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <user-name>
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "AccessKeyMetadata": [
    {
      "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
      "Status": "Active",
      "CreateDate": "2021-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: Access keys older than a few months without rotation or expiration may present a security risk.

10. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
Unverified Lambda Layer:

If Lambda functions use layers from untrusted or unverified sources, this should be flagged.

Output Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws lambda list-layers
Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Layers": [
    {
      "LayerName": "unverified-layer",
      "LayerVersion": 1
    }
  ]
}
Flagged as a vulnerability: Use of unverified third-party layers could introduce security risks from vulnerabilities in those layers.
